My Algebra Project
Project Overview:
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and classify music data based on its features. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, principal component analysis (PCA), and model training using logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM).
Features:
 Loads and preprocesses a music dataset
 Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables
 Standardizes features and applies PCA for dimensionality reduction
 Trains and evaluates multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
 Visualizes data with correlation heatmaps
 Predicts missing genre labels using machine learning models

Installation:
Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following installed:
 Python 3.x
 Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
You can install the necessary dependencies using:
pip install pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage:

Unzip the submitted file or Clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/Anatole2004/my_firt_projet.git)

Ensure your dataset (music_dataset_mod.csv) and legend file (Music Data Legend.xlsx) are in the correct directory.

Run the script:
python my_algebra_projet_update.py

Data:

The project uses a music_dataset_mod.csv file containing various features related to music tracks.

A Music Data Legend.xlsx file provides metadata about the dataset columns.

Results:

Displays dataset summary and missing values analysis.

Trains models and evaluates accuracy using classification reports.

Outputs predictions for missing genre labels.

File Structure:
The compressed file to be submitted is named Algebra_Projet.zip and contains the following 6 files:

Music Data Legend.xlsx

music_dataset_mod.csv

Projet_Report.docx

Readme.txt

my_algebra_projet.py
